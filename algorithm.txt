Algorithm:
Input: Number of queens (n), in this case, 8
Output: Arrangement of queens on the chessboard.
Step 1: Create a class called bisat, which will contain the logic for solving the n-queens problem.
Step 2: Define a function called qsub that takes in four stack objects representing the chessboard, the columns, and the two diagonals. This function will use recursion to place the queens on the board in all possible valid positions.
Step 3: Check if the size of the cols stack is equal to the number of queens, N. If so, return true, as we have placed all queens on the board.
Step 4: Loop over each row in the current column and check if it is safe to place a queen in that position using the safety function.
Step 5: If the position is safe, push the row index onto the board stack, push the column index onto the cols stack, and push the diagonal indices onto the diag1 and diag2 stacks. Then, recursively call qsub on the updated stacks.
Step 6: If the recursive call returns true, then we have found a valid solution and can return true.
Step 7: If the recursive call returns false, remove the last queen placed on the board by popping the top elements from the stacks.
Step 8: If no safe position is found in the current column, return false.
Step 9: Define a function called qmain that creates the necessary stacks and calls qsub. If qsub returns false, print a message indicating that no solution was found. Otherwise, call the printboard function and return true.
Step 10: Define a safety function that takes in the board and diagonal stacks, as well as the row and column indices of the queen being placed. This function checks if the queen is in conflict with any of the previously placed queens on the same row, diagonal1, or diagonal2.
Step 11: Define a printboard function that takes in the board and column stacks and prints out a visual representation of the board, with "Q" indicating the position of a queen and "." indicating an empty square.
Step 12: In the main function, create an instance of the bisat class and call its qmain function.
