Create a bisat class with functions to solve the puzzle recursively.
Create a qsub function that tries to place a queen in each row of the current column.
Check if the queen can be placed in the given box marked by board[i][col].
If yes, place the queen in the box and recursively call qsub function for the remaining columns.
If a solution is found, return true.
If placing the queen in board[i][col] doesn't lead to a solution, then remove the queen from the box (backtrack).
If the queen cannot be placed in any row in col, return false.
Create a qmain function that creates an empty chessboard and calls qsub function to solve the puzzle.
If a solution is found, call the printboard function to display the solution.
If a solution is not found, print an error message and return false.
Create a printboard function to display the solution.
Create a main function that creates an instance of the bisat class and calls its qmain function to solve the puzzle.
