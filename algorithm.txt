1) Begin at the leftmost column.
2) Return true if all queens are placed.
3) Try this with all rows in the current column.
4) Repeat for each tried row.
    a) If the queen can be safely placed in this row, then mark this [row, column] as part of the solution and check recursively if placing the queen here leads to a solution.
    b) Return true if placing the queen in [row, column] results in a solution.
    c) If placing the queen does not result in a solution, unmark this [row, column] (Backtrack) and return to step (a) to try other rows.
5) If all rows have been tried and nothing has worked, return false to start the backtracking process.
